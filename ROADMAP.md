# AwesomeSOS Product Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

## Vision
Create a fun, accessible way for adventurers to generate and share AI-powered safety information about their trips with friends and family.

## MVP (Week 1-2) - "Share Your Adventure" üöÄ

4. Friends/family can view the trip without signing up

### Technical Implementation

- [ ] Set up Supabase database
  - `trips` table (id, trip_description, trip_data, safety_info, share_id, created_at)
  - Enable RLS for basic security
- [ ] Integrate OpenAI/Claude API for safety generation
- [ ] Create shareable trip pages at `/trip/[shareId]`
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel with environment variables

#### Phase 2: Trip Creation Flow (2-3 days)
- [ ] Simplify trip form to single textarea + basic fields
  - "Describe your trip" (textarea)
  - Start/end dates
  - Emergency contact
- [ ] Generate AI safety content:
  - Location-specific emergency numbers
  - Activity-based safety tips

#### Phase 3: Shareable Trip Page (2-3 days)
- [ ] Beautiful mobile-first trip display page

## Quick Start Implementation Plan

### Tomorrow's Tasks
1. Set up Supabase project and create trips table
2. Get OpenAI/Claude API key
3. Modify trip form to use single description field
4. Create API endpoint for trip generation

### This Week's Goal
Have a working flow where someone can:
- Type: "I'm hiking Half Dome this weekend with my friend Sarah"
- Get back: Emergency numbers, safety tips, weather info, packing list
- Share: awesomesos.com/trip/abc123 with family

### Key Decisions Needed
1. Which AI API? (OpenAI GPT-4 vs Claude - recommend Claude for safety focus)
2. How much structure in the input? (recommend: mostly freeform with date picker)
3. Anonymous vs account required? (recommend: anonymous for MVP)
4. Custom domain? (recommend: deploy to Vercel with custom domain ASAP)

## Technical Shortcuts for Speed

1. **Skip authentication initially** - Use share IDs for security
2. **Use Vercel KV** for view counts instead of complex analytics
3. **Static emergency numbers** to start (expand later with APIs)
4. **Single prompt to AI** that returns all safety info as JSON
5. **Use Tailwind UI components** for faster development

## Sample AI Prompt for MVP

```
Generate safety information for this trip: [USER_DESCRIPTION]

Return a JSON with:
- location_name
- emergency_numbers (police, medical, park_ranger if applicable)
- weather_summary
- key_risks (3-5 items)
- safety_tips (5-7 actionable items)
- packing_essentials (8-10 items)
- fun_safety_score (1-10 with playful description)
- check_in_schedule (suggested times)
- local_resources (hospitals, ranger stations)

Make it informative but friendly and not scary. Include emojis.
```

## Revenue Ideas (Future)
- Premium weather/condition data
- Sponsored gear recommendations  
- White-label for outdoor companies
- API for other apps
- Trip insurance partnerships

## Next Action
Let's implement the Supabase setup and AI integration tomorrow to get the core flow working!
